## System Architecture

BearWatch follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture:


| Layer | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Model | Fetches and processes data from yfinance and News API; manages data structures (Pandas DataFrames, dictionaries). |
| View | Renders interactive charts, dashboards, and UI components using Dash, Plotly, HTML, and CSS. |
| Controller | Handles user input, API requests, and updates views in real time via Flask routes and Dash callbacks. |

**Key Patterns:**

- Observer (real-time updates), Repository (data access), Singleton (server instance), Facade (API abstraction).
